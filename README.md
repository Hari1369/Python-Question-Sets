# Python-Question-Sets

This repository contains practice scripts focused on Python’s four major collection data types: **Lists, Sets, Tuples, and Dictionaries**. All examples are written using manual logic without shortcuts, as part of my personal learning journey.

Each type has **10 basic questions** covering tasks like sorting, filtering, merging, and searching—aimed at understanding how data can be stored and handled using these structures in Python.

I’ll keep adding more question sets and logic-based solutions in this repository as I continue learning. Feedback is welcome! 🙏
